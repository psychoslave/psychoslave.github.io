I seize the opportunity of free room to thank some people that gave me the will
or inspiration to write this blog:
- Boris Marinov, who made me aware of Jekyll through is post [Human technology: Text files](https://boris-marinov.github.io/text/)
- [Jekyllâ€™s contributors](https://github.com/orgs/jekyll/people)
